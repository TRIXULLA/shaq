      <p>Now, this is a story all about how
        My life got flipped-turned upside down
        And I'd like to take a minute
        Just sit right there
        I'll tell you how I became a student in a town called Brampton<br>        
        In West Berbice born and raised 
        On the playground was where I spent most of my day,
        Chillin' out, maxin', relaxin', all cool 
        And shootin' some b-ball outside in the Hood
        When a couple of guys who were up to no good
        Started making trouble in my neighborhood
        I got in one little fight and my mom got scared
        She said, "You're movin' with your auntie and uncle in Brampton"
        I whistled for a cab and when it came near
        The license plate said, "Fresh" and it had dice in the mirror
        If anything I could say that this cab was rare
        But I thought "Nah, forget it, yo, holmes to Brampton"
        I pulled up to the house about seven or eight
        And I yelled to the cabbie, "Yo holmes, smell ya later"
        I looked at the house
        I was finally there
        To go to school as a student of Brampton &#128546;</p>
